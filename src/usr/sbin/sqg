# sqg - sbopkg queuefile generator
# A script designed to generate queuefiles for sbopkg with recursively-listed
# dependencies from the REQUIRES line of the .info files.

### OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION BELOW ###

SBOPKG_CONF=${SBOPKG_CONF:-/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf}

# If necessary, override SBOPKG_CONF above or directly from the environment.
# The user may want to change QUEUEDIR to a local temporary directory in $HOME
# since queuefiles in QUEUEDIR will be overwritten by this script. QUEUEDIR
# is commented out on purpose to get the user to review these variables.
# QUEUEDIR must be writable by the user executing the script. SKIP_EMPTY
# means the script will not create queuefiles for packages with an empty
# REQUIRES= line in the .info file. Uncomment or export a value to create
# queuefiles for packages with an empty REQUIRES= line (which will only
# contain the package name in the queuefile since there are no REQUIRES).

#QUEUEDIR=${QUEUEDIR:-/var/lib/sbopkg/queues}
REPO_BRANCH=${REPO_BRANCH:-$(cat /etc/slackware-version | awk '{print $2}')}
#SKIP_EMPTY=${SKIP_EMPTY:-NO}

### NO CHANGES SHOULD BE NECESSARY BELOW THIS LINE ###
